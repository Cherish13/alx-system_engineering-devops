##Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - Database Failure

###Issue Summary:
Duration: May 12, 2023, 14:00 UTC to May 13, 2023, 02:00 UTC
Impact: The web application was intermittently unavailable for approximately 12 hours, affecting 75% of the users. Users experienced slow response times and occasional errors when trying to access the service.

###Timeline:
*May 12, 2023, 14:00 UTC: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for high database latency.
*Investigation started, focusing on the database cluster and its performance metrics.
*Assumed root cause: Increased load on the database servers due to a recent feature deployment.
*Additional monitoring was set up to gather more detailed information about the database cluster.
*Misleading path: Initially, it was suspected that a misconfiguration in the load balancer might have caused the issue, leading to investigation in that direction.
*The incident was escalated to the database administration team and the development team for further analysis and assistance.
*May 12, 2023, 18:00 UTC: It was discovered that a disk failure occurred on one of the database servers, causing performance degradation.
*The faulty disk was replaced, and the affected database server was brought back online.
*May 13, 2023, 02:00 UTC: The incident was resolved, and the web application was fully operational again.

###Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a disk failure on one of the database servers. The failing disk caused increased latency and reduced throughput, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors for users.

To resolve the issue, the faulty disk was replaced with a new one, and the affected database server was restored to normal operation. The remaining healthy servers in the cluster were able to handle the database workload during the outage, ensuring the availability of the web application.

###Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect disk failures and other critical issues. Implement automated alerts for abnormal disk behavior.
2. Redundancy and failover: Implement a redundant database architecture with failover mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted service in case of hardware failures.
3. Load testing: Conduct thorough load testing before deploying new features or updates to identify potential performance issues and prevent sudden load spikes on the database servers.
4. Disaster recovery plan: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to mitigate the impact of future outages and ensure faster recovery times.
5. Regular hardware maintenance: Establish a regular hardware maintenance schedule, including routine checks for disk health and replacement of aging or faulty hardware components.

###Tasks:
*Implement disk health monitoring and alerts for the entire database cluster.
*Set up a redundant database architecture with automatic failover mechanisms.
*Conduct load testing for upcoming feature deployments to ensure optimal performance.
*Document and regularly test the disaster recovery plan, including clear guidelines for handling hardware failures.
*Establish a hardware maintenance schedule to proactively identify and replace failing components.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the resilience and stability of our web stack, minimizing the impact of future incidents and providing a better experience for our users.
